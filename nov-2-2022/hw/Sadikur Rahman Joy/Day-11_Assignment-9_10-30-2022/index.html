            Processor is the key component of a PC. It is also called Central
            Processing Unit (CPU). It can perform billions of additions or
            subtractions per second. Today's modern processors work in nano
            seconds.

            In computing and computer science, a processor or processing unit is
            an electrical component (digital circuit) that performs operations
            on an external data source, usually memory or some other data
            stream. It typically takes the form of a microprocessor, which can
            be implemented on a single metal-oxide-semiconductor integrated
            circuit chip. In the past, processors were constructed using
            multiple individual vacuum tubes, multiple individual transistors,
            or multiple integrated circuits. Today, processors use built-in
            transistors. The term is frequently used to refer to the central
            processing unit (CPU) in a system. However, it can also refer to
            other coprocessors, such as a graphics processing unit (GPU).
            Traditional processors are typically based on silicon however,
            researchers have developed experimental processors based on
            alternative materials such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and alloys
            made of elements from groups three and five of the periodic table.
            Transistors made of a single sheet of silicon atoms one atom tall
            and other 2D materials have been researched for use in processors.
            Quantum processors have been created; they use quantum superposition
            to represent bits (called qubits) instead of only an on or off
            state.
